## How To Play

- If you don't have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) installed, you can simply double click the .exe file to play the game.
  **Note:** _The .exe file needs to stay in the same directory as the sounds, images, and font folders._

Install Pygame ```pip install pygame```

- If you have the correct version of Python and Pygame installed, you can run the program in the command prompt / terminal.

```bash
cd PyShooter
python main.py
```
